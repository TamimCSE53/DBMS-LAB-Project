Project Description:
CP School is a comprehensive educational platform developed as a course project for the Database Management System (CSE 316) at UITS. Created by 5th semester Computer Science students, this platform aims to provide structured learning resources focused on programming languages and key competitive programming topics such as Graph Theory, Dynamic Programming (DP), Trees, Number Theory, and the Standard Template Library (STL).
The project integrates a user-friendly interface with interactive content, quizzes, and practical problem-solving exercises to help learners deepen their understanding and improve their coding skills. The backend is designed using database concepts to efficiently store and manage user data, search history, and progress tracking, demonstrating practical DBMS principles learned during the course.
While some parts of the coding process were assisted by AI tools, the team has customized and developed the majority of the platform independently to ensure originality and quality. The project is continuously evolving, with plans for incremental updates and feature enhancements to expand the learning materials and improve the user experience.

CP School not only serves as an educational aid for students interested in competitive programming but also acts as a practical demonstration of database management and web development skills acquired in the course.
